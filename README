# RNP -- Rapid Numerical Prototyping

A simple library for common numerical computations.

The [design rationale](about.html) behind the library was to make it maximally easy to use, with performance a secondary consideration.
It turns out however, that for most high level algorithms, there is only one good way to implement them, so the performance tends to be quite good.

## Status

Currently, RNP supports all common linear algebra operations typically used in the physical sciences.
In this respect, RNP is currently feature complete, but a few interfaces are not finalized, certain parameters are not respected, and memory allocation is not optimal. (Actually, as of the writing of this README, all interfaces included are finalized and only iteration limits might not be respected.)
